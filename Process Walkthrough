<> Employee Attrition Model Walkthrough <>

**For this project, I used the "Attrition Rate of a Company" data set by ANUJ BISWAS on Kaggle. Public domain license.**

This project aims to build a predictive model adaptable to various purposes, such as analyzing retention rates, 
identifying key retention variables, predicting customer purchase rates, and understanding the factors influencing these behaviors.

For this project, I chose to develop a logistic regression model to predict whether employees are likely to leave a company. 
While exploring other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), I decided on logistic regression for the following reasons:

1.) Scalability with Large Datasets: Logistic regression handles large datasets efficiently. In contrast, SVMs, while powerful and 
mathematically sophisticated, can become computationally expensive with larger data sizes.

2.) Interpretability: Logistic regression offers the advantage of interpretability. Its coefficients directly represent the impact 
of individual variables on the outcome, allowing for actionable insights. This is more challenging with SVMs, as their kernel-based 
approach often obscures variable-level interpretability. This approach ensures that the model is not only predictive but also provides 
valuable insights into the dynamics of employee attrition, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
