<> Employee Attrition Model Walkthrough <>
**For this project, I used the "Attrition Rate of a Company" data set by ANUJ BISWAS on Kaggle. Public domain license.**

This project aims to build a predictive model adaptable to various purposes, such as analyzing retention rates, 
identifying key retention variables, predicting customer purchase rates, and understanding the factors influencing these behaviors.

For this project, I chose to develop a logistic regression model to predict whether employees are likely to leave a company. 
While exploring other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), I decided on logistic regression for the following reasons:

1.) Scalability with Large Datasets: Logistic regression handles large datasets efficiently. In contrast, SVMs, while powerful and 
mathematically sophisticated, can become computationally expensive with larger data sizes.

2.) Interpretability: Logistic regression offers the advantage of interpretability. Its coefficients directly represent the impact 
of individual variables on the outcome, allowing for actionable insights. This is more challenging with SVMs, as their kernel-based 
approach often obscures variable-level interpretability. This approach ensures that the model is not only predictive but also provides 
valuable insights into the dynamics of employee attrition, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.


--Implementation--
To implement the employee attrition model, I followed a structured approach using Python and the scikit-learn library. Below is a 
  summary of the main steps I used:

Data Loading:
  The dataset was loaded using the pandas library, which allows for efficient manipulation and analysis of tabular data.

Data Cleaning:
  Missing values were removed using the dropna() function to ensure the dataset was clean and free of incomplete entries.
  This simplifies preprocessing and ensures the model is trained on reliable data.

Encoding the Target Variable:
  The target variable, Attrition, was converted from categorical values (Yes, No) to numerical values (1, 0) to make it compatible 
  with the logistic regression model.

Feature Selection:
  I selected the most relevant features based on domain knowledge and theoretical importance. These include factors such as age, job 
  satisfaction, and monthly income, as detailed in the Philosophy section below.

Data Splitting:
  The dataset was split into training and test sets (70% training, 30% testing) to evaluate model performance on unseen data. 
  This ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.

Model Training and Prediction:
  A logistic regression model was trained using the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn. The liblinear solver was chosen 
  for its efficiency with smaller datasets. Predictions were made on the test set to assess model performance.

Performance Evaluation:
  Model accuracy was calculated using scikit-learn’s accuracy_score function to measure how well the predictions matched the actual outcomes.


-Philosophy-

To simplify the model and focus on the most actionable insights, I selected key variables with the highest theoretical relevance to employee 
attrition. These included age, tenure, satisfaction scores, work-life balance, income, and salary hikes. This selection ensured that 
the model remained interpretable and practical, while still achieving strong predictive accuracy for attrition. Furthermore, 
the simplified model allows non-technical users to focus on addressing the most impactful factors contributing to attrition, such as improving 
work-life balance and satisfaction levels. A breakdown of the variables are below.

  1.) Age: Represents the employee's age, which may correlate with career progression stages and attrition likelihood.
  2.) DistanceFromHome: The distance (in kilometers) between the employee’s residence and workplace. Greater distances
  might negatively impact work-life balance and increase attrition risk.
  3.) EnvironmentSatisfaction: Employee’s satisfaction with the overall work environment, measured on a scale of 1 (Low) to 4 (Very High). 
  Dissatisfaction may drive attrition.
  4.) JobSatisfaction: Employee’s satisfaction with their job role, measured on a scale of 1 (Low) to 4 (Very High). Higher satisfaction 
  typically reduces attrition risk.
  5.) WorkLifeBalance: Employee’s perceived balance between work and personal life, measured on a scale of 1 (Bad) to 4 (Best). 
  Poor work-life balance is a common driver of attrition.
  6.) MonthlyIncome: The employee’s monthly income, reflecting financial motivation. Lower incomes might increase attrition risk,
  particularly for employees dissatisfied with other factors.
  7.) YearsAtCompany: Total number of years the employee has spent with the company. Employees with shorter tenures may be more likely to leave.
  8.) YearsSinceLastPromotion: Number of years since the employee’s last promotion. Longer gaps may indicate stagnation and increase the likelihood 
  of attrition
  9.) YearsWithCurrManager: Number of years the employee has worked under their current manager. Strong manager-employee relationships often reduce 
  attrition risk.
  10.) PercentSalaryHike: Percentage increase in the employee’s salary over the last year. Higher salary hikes can enhance employee satisfaction 
  and reduce attrition.


-Conclusion-
This project demonstrates the use of a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition, balancing interpretability with performance. 
The approach of focusing on key variables, cleaning the data, and evaluating model accuracy ensures the insights generated are both actionable,
meaningful, easily interpretable and simple. I believe this model is also still very flexible in that it can be adapted to many different situations as
as stated earlier.
